      <p> First on the list is the place where I grew up and currently reside, the great state of Texas. My family moved to Texas in the summer of 1997 as I turned seven years old. It was here that I grew up and graduated from high school, mostly in that order. Almost all of my memories between the ages of seven and eighteen are from my time spent in Texas. I thoroughly enjoyed my childhood, and would not trade it for anyone else's. Not to mention...
    </p>
       <ul>
         <li>My wife and I were married in Hooks, TX.</li>
         <li>Our son was born here in Tyler, TX.</li>
         <li>I have emensly enjoyed my time as a band director at Como-Pickton, TX</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Texas has been good to me, and God bless Texas!</p>

    <p>Tennessee has caught my attention and my heart the last few years, leading me to believe that the best states start with the letter T. In the time I have spent in the "volunteer state," I have fond memories and am captivated by the landscapes and culture of specifically the northeast tip, due to the time my in-laws resided in the tri-city area along with my sister-in-law and her husband. Truth be told, as George Strait sings I too would "hang my hat in Tenneessee," just for different reasons. Reasons to live in the tri-city area of northeast Tennessee include, but are not limited to...
      <ol>
        <li> Its beautiful mountains
        </li>
        <li> Annual snow
        </li>
        <li> Friendly people
        </li>
        <li> Plenty to do within a short driving distance
        </li>
        <li> Fond memories with family

      <p> Florida is great for at least one reason, and naturally that would be Disney World (the superior version of Disney Land). I know that there are plenty other reasons to like Florida, but to be honest, that's my one reason. Part of my honeymoon with my gorgeous wife was spent on a Disney Cruise ship sailing out from and returning to Cape Canaveral. I suppose I could actually name this section "Main Street, USA" in following with the theme, but that wouldn't give Florida it's due. My favorite Disney trips in no specific order are:
      <ul>
        <li>Honey Moon Disney Cruise</li>
        <li>Disney Trip with just Emily and myself</li>
        <li>Justin and Ali's Disney wedding</li>

    <p>
    For significant reasons, Louisiana, comes in at number four on the list.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>I met my lovely wife in Louisiana</li>
    <li>Our daughter was born in Alexandria, LA</li>
    <li>I went to Louisiana Tech University</li>
    <li>I learned to hunt duck, deer, and most of my fishing in LA</li>
    <li>I held my first job as a band director in Jena, LA</li>
    <li>I found crawfish and boudin</li>
  </ol>
  <p> All three of those reasons are very dear to my heart, and again, I made so many wonderful memories while during the nine years that I lived there with my wife and daughter. It's just not my favorite place culturally, and it's more strenuous being a band director there than in Texas. But, I certainly do enjoy going back to visit places like Ruston, Natchitoches, Shreveport, and ocassionaly Alexandria. Just watch out for those Saints fans...</p>

     <h3>"The Natural State"</h3>
    <p>Beautiful Arkansas, the "Natural State"!... at least were we lived until I was seven. My brother and I were born in Searcy and lived in Heber Springs at the base of the Southern Ozarks, not far from Greers Ferry Lake. Our dad's parents and siblings lived close by as well, and we would come back to visit many times after having moved down to Texas. It's where I learned to drive cars, tractors, and four wheeler's (that's ATV's for you city folk). My brother and I experienced our first tornado warning, climbing down in the storm shelter with my grandparents. When I was sixteen, I got to come back up for a month to live with my uncle. While I was there I got to spend a lot of time with some friends from the area, get to know new people, and just enjoy my summer break. I also...
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Biked down Sugarloaf Mountain, going so fast I ended up hurling at the base</li>
    <li>Cruised around town with Chris in his new F150</li>
    <li>Spent the Fourth of July on the beach, watching fireworks with my new firends from church</li>
  </ul>
    
    <p>It was a memorable summer and we had many fun times throughout the years in Arkansas.</p>
